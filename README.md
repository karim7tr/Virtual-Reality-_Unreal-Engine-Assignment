# Virtual-Reality-_Unreal-Engine-Assignment

## Overview

Welcome to the Virtual Reality Unreal Engine Assignment! This readme provides details on the landscape setup, materials, and elements included in the project. The assignment aims to create a diverse environment within Unreal Engine, incorporating elements like mountains, a lake, a desert Sahara, a stone-built house, plants, and a fiery mountain top.

## Unreal Engine Version

This project was developed using Unreal Engine 4.27. Ensure you have the same version installed for compatibility.

## Landscape Specifications

- **Section Size:** 31x31
- **Section per Component:** 1x1
- **Number of Components:** 8x8
- **Overall Resolution:** 249x249

These specifications define the grid layout and dimensions of the landscape, providing a framework for building the virtual environment.

## Landscape Materials and Elements

### Materials

1. **Desert Sahara Material (Base Material):** This material forms the foundation of the desert landscape, creating the sandy terrain.
2. **Lake Material:** Used to depict the water body within the environment.
3. **Stone Material for House:** Applied to create a stone-built house, adding architectural elements to the landscape.
4. **Plant Materials:** Various plant materials are scattered across the landscape to add greenery and vegetation.
5. **Fire Material for Mountain Top:** A specialized material at the head of the mountain simulating a fiery effect.

### Elements

- **Desert Sahara:** Sandy terrain representing a desert landscape.
- **Lake:** A water body integrated into the environment.
- **Stone-Built House:** A large house constructed with stone materials.
- **Plants:** Vegetation distributed across the landscape.
- **Mountains:** Geography includes mountains with a fiery top, adding depth and context to the environment.
